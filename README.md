# Project - World's Oldest Businesses

An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, I explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?

Like many business problems, the data is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, I first needed to use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, I used manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.
